## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Element heights are relative if we are using % and is relative to its parent. So never forget about parent height if determining height of child element using relative unit, it can stuck you for more than 2 days and you won't be able to find your mistake.

Changed image color by opacity, though not perfect.

```css
@media (max-width: 960px) and (min-width: 550px){
  body{
    height:auto;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I will be focusing on relative units of properties and will try to improve on flexbox.
